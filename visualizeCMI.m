%% visualizeCMI

%% load data

%% load electrode locations
% can get MNI coordinates? 

%% [preprocessing steps?]
%  - correct for many multiple comparisons
%  - exclude non-adjacent channels? or threshold based on distance? 


%% plot significant electrode pairs in time 

% create video object

% plot standard brain 
plotMNIbrain() 

% loop over time points // frames. 
for frm = 1:length(timePoints)

% plot arrows/lines/patches indicating significant sCMI at each timepoint.
